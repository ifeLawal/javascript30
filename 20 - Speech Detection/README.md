# 20 - Speech Detection

**Recaps provided by yhabib, edited by me.*

Worked with Javascript recognition web api which is built in to listen to audio and print it to a notepad.

The idea is to use the native speech recognition from the browser to build like a SpeechNotebook where each sentence will be in a different paragraph, that means that once the user stops talking a new we will append a new **p** element.

### Notes
This exercise needs to be run in a server in order to be able to have access to the media devices!!

The [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) has two components: the [SpeechRecognition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition) and the [SpeechSythesis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis). In this first project we are focusing in the first component.

We initialize it like this:

```javascript
// Chrome special prefix
window.SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition;

const recognition = new SpeechRecognition();
recognition.interimResults = true;  //As you are speaking gives values rather than waiting till you end speaking       
```

Handling the result event is the most important part of this exercise. It is in **e.results** were we can find most of the relevant information. This is an array where we can find the **transcript**, a value between [0, 1] that shows the **confidence** of the transcription and a *isFinal* boolean which tells you if the user stopped talking to start in a new paragraph.

```javascript
recognition.addEventListener('result', e => {
    const transcript = Array.from(e.results)
        .map(result => result[0])
        .map(result => result.transcript)
        .join('');

    p.textContent = transcript;
    if(e.results[0].isFinal) {
        p = document.createElement('p');
        words.appendChild(p);
    }
});
```
Finally we append a new element to the **div** and rebind the listener to the **result** event.

### Events
* result -> Once we get it, the listener unbinds itself
* end -> We use it to rebind it ðŸ˜€

## To Do's
1. [ ] Implemente some basic functionality like Siri:
