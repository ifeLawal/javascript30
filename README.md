# JavaScript30
All the lessons from the awesome free to watch course [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) by Wes Bos.

Build 30 things in 30 days with 30 tutorials.
NO frameworks, NO compilers, NO libraries, NO boilerplate.

A big thanks to Alex's [Javascript30](https://github.com/afuh/js30) which
provided the logic for the addcontent code in main.js and
Yusef's [JS30](https://github.com/yhabib/JavaScript30/) for
his super cool checklist.
