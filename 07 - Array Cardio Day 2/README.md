# 07 - Array Cardio Day 2

**Recaps provided by yhabib, edited by me.*

The continuation of the array workout takes us to use some new build-in methods:

- [some](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some)
- [every](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every)
- [find](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find)
- [findIndex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex)

### Notes
There is a nice trick implemented in this exercise. Following a *functional-programming* style and making use fo the ES6 spread operator we delete an element from an array without leaving empty places:

```javascript
const index = comments.findIndex(comment => comment.id === 823423);
const newComments = [         
	...comments.slice(0, index),
	...comments.slice(index + 1, comments.length)
];
```
