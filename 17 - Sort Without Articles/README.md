# 17 - Sort Without Articles

**Recaps provided by yhabib, edited by me.*

This one was a short one, the idea was to sort an array of Bands without taking care of the article.

### Notes
* How to strip a word with regular expressions:

```javascript
    function strip(bandName) {
        return bandName.replace(/^(a |the |an )/i, '').trim();
    }
```

* Sorting and coupling to the html element:

```javascript
    const sortedBands = bands.sort((a, b) => strip(a) > strip(b) ? 1 : -1);
    document.querySelector('#bands').innerHTML = sortedBands.map(band => `<li>${band}</li>`).join('');
```
