# Javascript Drum Kit

I learned to use window.onload, queryselectors, data-attrs, audio tags to play
sound, e.keycode, and transitionend events.

To do
- make the system take in an input of keys and play it one by one by 3000ms or something
- all I think I need, settimeout, array, and new playsound function
