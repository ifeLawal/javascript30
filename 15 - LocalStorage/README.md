# 15 - LocalStorage

**Recaps provided by yhabib, edited by me.*

Allows the user to insert new dishes to be prepared. This dishes are going to be persistent. For that we are using the LocalStorage. We also work here with **event delegation**, that happens when we want to attach a listener to an element that is going to be created in the future, in this case the checkboxes related to each dish.

### Notes
##### In this exercise I didn't wrap all the js code inside a IIFE because doing that doesn't allow to inspect the variables inside the web browser's console!!

* Working with **localStorage** to make data persistent when refreshing the browser. API:
    * localStorage.get(key);
    * localStorage.set(key, value); // It expects plain strings so if the value is an Object -> JSON.stringify(value)
    * localStorage.delete(key);

* When working with **submit** events one has to consider that the browser is going to make a redirggection to the same url plus the value of the form(GET). So in order to inspect the in-halt:
    * In the developer tools -> Preserve log
    * e.preventDefault(); // Inside the event handler. No redirection at all
* Event Delegation: When listening for an event in something higher and then inside we check if it is the actually thing that we want:
    * A parent element is responsible but its children aren't.
    * He takes the responsibility and then inside the event handler checks if it's correct

```javascript
itemsList.addEventListener('click', toggleDone);    // itemsList is an - first
function toggleDone(e) {
    if (!e.target.matches('input')) return;         // checks if its the desired child
    ...                                             // delegates the handler
}
```

* Using **data-index** to bind the position of the item in the array with an html component!
* How to create custom checkboxes using CSS:

```javascript
    // hide original boxes
    .plates input {
      display: none;
    }

    .plates input + label:before {
      content: '⬜️';
      margin-right: 10px;
    }

    .plates input:checked + label:before {
      content: '🌮';
    }
```


**Note:** *If one wants to do it smarter so calling populateList will only update a new elements instead of recreating again the whole innerHtml -> AngularJs, React, ... two way bindings ...*

### Events
* **submit:** in the callback the **this** object is the form
* **click**
